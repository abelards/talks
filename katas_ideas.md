Please see katas.md to get how it works.
Feel free to comment or elaborate on these!


## DocumentFactory
    - I have three teams: data, content, and emailing.
    - the data people create some awesome reportings
    - the content people create beautiful email/web/print templates
    - I want to plug an abstract report to a data source
    - then have the emailing guys batch-print and send all this

## Boardgames' lobby
    - I want to play board games on the Web
    - I'd like the usual "Social Networking" stuff: profile, friends, messages
    - Also the usual "gamification": scores, leaderboards, achievements
    - We'll add new games to the platform so have a clean, stable, extensible API
    - I can set private rooms and tournaments with custom rules with my friends
    - the public lobby will match people of similar skill level and play habits

## Strategy game
    - I love Heroes of Might and Magic II, Fire Emblem, and Advance Wars
    - please make a mix of all this on the Web

## Airport certifications
    - There are certifications per airport, aircraft type, aircraft...
    - Make me a correct bookkeeping and matching software
