# Hack Your Brain
This is actually a series of talks.

## Introduction
We're curious minds, hackers and tinkerers. We love to tweak our tools.
But our most important and wonderful tool is our own brain.
How can we understand what's going on so we can hack it?

## Companion Slides

I've added pictures of brilliant minds on each slides.
You can find all the trivia in "Hack Your Brain - Trivia".

## Intelligence
The one point is: if you believe you can improve, you will.

## Expertise
Use deliberate practice, and practice makes perfect.

## Memory
It's a graph. You should optimize your learning method to:
* store and retrieve information using already known bits
* see or create similarities, difference, personal and emotional links
* ping yourself or use Anki (ankisrs.net) and others to reinforce memorization

## Toolbox
The Feynam method tells it all: explain in simple terms, ask questions, question everything.

## Conclusion
It's all about managing health, motivation and time!
