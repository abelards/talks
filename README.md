# Past & Present Talks
Mostly notes and outlines on talks I have done or will do.

## Comment on them
You like an idea and would like to know more?
You would have done a talk of mine quite differently?
Let me know!

## Vote for them
If you feel some ideas in the "ideas" file deserve a better treatment, ping me.

## Steal them!
Also, feel free to pick ideas from here and make your own talk!
Just tell me: if you like the theme and do the work, I'd love to sit and listen to you :)

Thanks,
