# Egoless everything
"A strange game. The only winning move is not to play."

Ego drives us crazy.
It ruins projects, careers, businesses, friendships, and people.

Freshmen, schools, recruiters, teams, managers...

I'd like to
* take a few examples, with context,
* explain how you can find out what's actually happening,
* and hopefully plan how you could defuse it before it explodes.

And as they say in the army:
"Shit can only go up. But when it goes down, it splashes everybody."
