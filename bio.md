# Bio
All conferences require a bio, but no two conferences are the same.

## Short
Sylvain Ab√©lard is a problem solver at Faveod & ParisRB.
He mostly uses Ruby, Rails and asking questions to help people.

## DevsLoveBacon
Sylvain's grandfathers are a wine-maker and a baker. He spent his youth in several countrysides in France, where he learnt to love food, beverages, and being as arrogant as is appropriate for any self-respecting frenchman.
He was lucky enough to attend EPITA and meet very talented people there, fell in love with obscure stuff, and basically learnt to be a hipster before it was cool.
Sylvain is a partner at Faveod where he plays daily with Ruby, Rails, JS, and asks trick questions to solve people's problems.

## ArrrrCamp
Sylvain is a Quartermaster at Faveod, hacking and slashing problems with Ruby, Rails, JS, and trick questions.
He sailed from the coast of western France and ended up raiding merchant ships in Paris, "fluctuat nec mergitur".
He fought his way with evil, heartless pirates at EPITA and learnt some good insults there.
Sylvain still have both legs and eyes valid (though wearing glasses) and will defend them dearly.
