# Bio
All conferences require a bio, but no two conferences are the same.

## Short
Sylvain Abélard is a problem solver at Faveod & ParisRB.
He mostly uses Ruby, Rails and asking questions to help people.

## DevsLoveBacon
Sylvain's grandfathers are a wine-maker and a baker. He spent his youth in several countrysides in France, where he learnt to love food, beverages, and being as arrogant as is appropriate for any self-respecting frenchman.
He was lucky enough to attend EPITA and meet very talented people there, fell in love with obscure stuff, and basically learnt to be a hipster before it was cool.
Sylvain is a partner at Faveod where he plays daily with Ruby, Rails, JS, and asks trick questions to solve people's problems.
