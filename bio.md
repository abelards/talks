# Bio
**All conferences require a bio, but no two conferences are the same.**

## Short
Sylvain Abélard is a problem solver at Faveod.
He mostly uses Ruby, Rails and asking questions to help people.
He's co-organiser at ParisRB and would love to welcome you in beautiful Paris, France.

## DevsLoveBacon
Sylvain's grandfathers are a wine-maker and a baker. He spent his youth in several countrysides in France, where he learnt to love food, beverages, and being as arrogant as is appropriate for any self-respecting frenchman.
He was lucky enough to attend EPITA and meet very talented people there, fell in love with obscure stuff, and basically learnt to be a hipster before it was cool.
Sylvain is a partner at Faveod where he plays daily with Ruby, Rails, JS, and asks trick questions to solve people's problems.

## ArrrrCamp
Sylvain is a Quartermaster at Faveod, hacking and slashing problems with Ruby, Rails, JS, and trick questions.
He sailed from the coast of western France and ended up raiding merchant ships in Paris, "fluctuat nec mergitur".
He fought his way with evil, heartless pirates at EPITA and learnt some good insults there.
Sylvain still have both legs and eyes valid (though wearing glasses) and will defend them dearly.

## Speaking Background
I'm a regular speaker at french events like @ParisRB and @HumanTalks
Nothing huge: ParisRB is big (100~130 monthly attendees) but people don't pay for it, it's at the end of the day, and has a set back atmosphere.
I've been lucky to be accepted at @DevsLoveBacon and speak about cognac (french brandy) in mid-April 2013.

This one is about geek health and was actually quite funny, esp. at 10' when the crowd participates and gives insights on things they tried. I'm very sorry the questions have not been recorded because they were great.

Please don't judge harshly: I did the slides in an hour or so, and no talk rehearsal.
And we only recently started to film the talks.
