# Ideas
These are talk ideas, nothing written up yet.

### Technical
* Storing & Retrieving: a talk about the "basic" data structures, and common implementations
* Writing a compiler from scratch: memories from school, some steps that are often overlooked and good to know
* Object-Oriented is: message passing, or inheritance? (lightning)

### Science
* Hack Your Bullshit Detector: how marketing fools you everyday
* Game Theory: some famous games and applications
* Language Theory

### About my job
* (meta-)rogramming (meta-)programming
* Beyond the speed limit / What happens when you go too fast
* Fun or not Fun
    - tests are not fun, but we do it because debugging code is even more painful
    - what if we had automatic proof systems?

### Devs
* How to ask questions / bug reports
* Recruiting - well, ask @matthieusegret for that ;)
* Negociating - well, ask @tibastral for that ;)
* Egoless: Ego mixes up (and messes up!) many things. Freshmen, schools, recruiters, teams, managers...

### Fun talks
* Dumb Ways to Code: using "Dumb Ways to Die" pictures to draw similarities with smells.
  I'm late to the party because the meme faded out, but hey.
* Slide Karaoke: I'm doing a few decks on (design, architecture, code) smells
  So I can share them and have people do a PPT karaoke :)
