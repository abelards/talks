# Ideas
These are talk ideas, nothing written up yet.

### technical
* Storing & Retrieving: a talk about the "basic" data structures, and common implementations
* Back to the past: when CS people were mathematicians and wrote incredible proofs

### about my job
* (meta-)rogramming (meta-)programming
* Beyond the speed limit / What happens when you go too fast

### jobs
* How to ask questions / bug reports
* Recruiting - well, ask @matthieusegret for that ;)
* Negociating - well, ask @tibastral for that ;)
* Egoless: Ego mixes up (and messes up!) many things. Freshmen, schools, recruiters, teams, managers...
