# Ideas
These are talk ideas, nothing big written up yet.
**Comment on them, vote for them, steal them!**
If you feel some ideas in this file deserve a better treatment, ping me.

Also, feel free to pick ideas from here and make your own talk!
Just tell me: if you like the theme and do the work, I'd love to sit and listen to you :)


### More detailed
I am already fleshing out some topics, which may or may not become talks:
* Beware of magic and defaults: lessons from the Rails YAML vulnerability
* Grammar for developers: how language helps you find design smells
* Simple needs, complex options: examples of hidden complexity
* No Silver Bullet: what is actually the moral of this?
* Egoless Everything: Ego mixes up (and messes up!) many things. Watch & learn
Here again: comment, vote, and steal!


### Games & Katas
I've been impressed by @cyriux's DDD games or architectural katas.
I love them and want every developer to know about them.

Either I'm getting him talk at ParisRB, or I make the talk myself.
But I'm no expert (yet) so ask for the real thing ;)


### Technical
* Storing & Retrieving: a talk about the "basic" data structures, and common implementations
* Writing a compiler from scratch: memories from school, some steps that are often overlooked and good to know
* Lightning: is Object-Oriented message passing, or inheritance?


### About my job
* (meta-)rogramming (meta-)programming
* Beyond the speed limit / What happens when you go too fast
* Fun or not Fun
    - tests are not fun, but we do it because debugging code is even more painful
    - what if we had automatic proof systems?

### Devs
* How to ask questions / bug reports
* Recruiting - well, ask @matthieusegret for that ;)
* Negociating - well, ask @tibastral for that ;)
* We were superheroes - how coding on Casio and TI89 made us dream
* The Storm is Coming - danger in the Cloud!
* Words of the Rising Sun: kanban, baka yoke...

### Science
For now it's mostly Lightnings: I'm no expert, but I'd give the basic hypotheses, interesting results and applications.
* Hack Your Bullshit Detector: how marketing fools you everyday

* Game Theory: some famous games and applications

* Lightning: Language Theory
* Lightning: Behavioural Economics
* Lightning: Evolutionary Psychology

### Fun talks
* Dumb Ways to Code: using "Dumb Ways to Die" pictures to draw similarities with smells.
  I'm late to the party because the meme faded out, but hey.
* Slide Karaoke: I'm doing a few decks on (design, architecture, code) smells
  So I can share them and have people do a PPT karaoke :)
