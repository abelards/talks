# Ruby Press Pack
* I see lots of sad developers: I do Ruby at night, my day job is depressing.
* I see lots of sad managers: I'd love to hire Rubyists but I can't find them.
**That's a problem, and an opportunity. Why? How to solve this?**

## Talk

### Problems: why they're afraid
and how to solve it
* no docs? not true
* not known? not true
* not enough people?
    - Well, there are some, work on it.
* Ruby devs are too expensive
    - How cheap is a failed/late project?
* You have other technologies in place
    - This is only a valid answer if you're satisfied with what you have today
    - Yes, but you can integrate them
* FUD: security, performance, ...
    - RailsSec is more reactive than most other stacks
    - JRuby has great performance, many other tricks are available

### Solutions: act now!
* there ARE jobs, and not only in startups
* there are efforts for more french docs: @happynoff
* community, communication, training, classes
