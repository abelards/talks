## Introduction
This talk is all about cognac and brandies.

What you can read on the label and what it all means.

Its land and its centuries-old, rich and complex history.

The fascinating alchemy that turns a grape into cognac.

Its differences and relationships with other beverages.

And of course... how to taste this golden, divine-smelling drink.


Not drinking? This talk is for anyone who marvel at tinkerers, experiments, hidden secrets and nature's gifts: cognac has all this
and much more! Please enjoy... with moderation.
