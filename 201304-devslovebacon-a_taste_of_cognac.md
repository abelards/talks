**Cognac is basically a spirit aging in charred oak barrels,
which over time gives color, smell and taste.**

# A taste of Cognac
I gave this talk at DevsLoveBacon.com
A conference about everything developers love, in London (UK) on April 12-13th, 2013
http://devslovebacon.com/conferences/bacon-2013/talks/a-taste-of-cognac

## Introduction
This talk is all about cognac and brandies.  
What you can read on the label and what it all means.  
Its land and its centuries-old, rich and complex history.  
The fascinating alchemy that turns a grape into cognac.  
Its differences and relationships with other beverages.  
And of course... how to taste this golden, divine-smelling drink.

Not drinking? This talk is for anyone who marvel at tinkerers, experiments, hidden secrets and nature's gifts: cognac has all this
and much more! Please enjoy... with moderation.



## Cognac and brandies
The word "brandy" comes from "brand wijn", dutch for "burnt wine".
The dutch merchants found out it was easier to distillate wine for transportation,
So "Brandies" are everything that's distillated twice.

Armagnac is only done in the french region of Armagnac (with tower pot-stills),
and got less lucky with commerce (access to the river Charente was key to Cognac's commerce).
Cognac is only done in the french region of Cognac with rounder, necked pot-stills.

## Ages and criteria
Age is counted at "years in the barrel": once in a bottle, it stops ageing.  
Just like whiskies, Cognacs are usually a blend. We use the youngest spirit's age:  
* VS: 2~4 years
* VSOP: 4~6 years
* XO: 6+ years... so that's actually a wide, wide range!
You should read the label or ask the producer.

But why do you sometimes find "champagne" on a Cognac bottle?  
The region of Cognac is also divided in areas, from most to less noble:  
Grande Champagne, Petite Champagne, Borderies, Fins Bois, Bons Bois, Bois Ordinaires.

## Making of


## Tasting
Don't hurry, and enjoy the pleasure of every sense.

**Serve** whenever possible in tulip glass, to magnify taste and smell

**Look** at the colour, and swirl it in the glass to see the 'tears'

**Warm** it with your hand and let it breathe for 30s/year of age

**Smell** it from your arm's length, then bring it closer, and feel the difference

**Drink** with small sips, and let your palate rest between each sip

**Taste** the fruity, flowery, spicy and wooden aromas

## Pairings
* Cognac is often enjoyed with coffee, chocolate or cigars.
* Pineau is grape must with cognac, it's a great, sweet drink.
* Grand Marnier is Cognac with Cointreau (and Cointreau, triple-distilled sour oranges)

* young (VS) cognacs are often enjoyed as long drinks (often some tonic)
* VSOP can be great with ice
* drink you XO as you like, remember to enjoy the longer aftertastes
